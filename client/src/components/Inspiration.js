      <p>The app starts from my own experience of using Spotify as I categorize my tracks based on moods (rather than genres or artists). Rather than browsing through hundreds of tracks on Spotify playlists, this is what I'd prefer: something/someone that can detect my mood and offer me the most suitable tracks (from my own many tracks, not from the Spotify corpus) with least effort. </p>
      <p>And Moodify is that something/someone.</p>

      <h3>Access</h3>
      <p>The app requires a Spotify account and needs access to your Spotify account.</p>

      <h3>Privacy</h3>
      <p>No data (including your pictures and videos) will be saved from your usage. It only uses cookies to support better sessions and thus user experience.</p>
